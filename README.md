# Yocto CVE Parser

Tool for parsing Yocto's CVE checker output json file. Provides some filtering, sorting and display options to help you get the most of the report. Run with Python and -h option to get the current usage guide:

```
python3 ./cve-parser.py -h
```

The only mandatory option is `-f` to provide the path json file output by Yocto. Rest of the options can be used to filter and modify the output of the program. By default, it prints package name, CVE-ID, CVSSv2, CVSSv3, status and link for the unpatched CVE issues.
